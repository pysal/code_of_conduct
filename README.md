Code of Conduct: Resolution Annoucements
========================================

This repository serves a shell to house the public annoucements of the [`PySAL`](http://pysal.org) Code of Conduct Committee. Annoucements of resolutions can be found in the `gitter` channel here: [![Gitter chat](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/pysal/code_of_conduct.svg?style=plastic)](https://gitter.im/pysal/code_of_conduct)

The `gitter` channel should **not** be used to publicly air grievances. Should the need arise to file a complaint, please follow the steps outlined below.

 1. Review the [`PySAL` Code of Conduct](http://pysal.org/placeholder_coc)
 2. Review the [`PySAL` Code of Conduct Reporting Procedure](http://pysal.org/placeholder_coc_reporting)
 3. Notify the Code of Conduct Committee at <pysal-conduct@googlegroups.com>
